# InnerQuest

InnerQuest is an app designed to help you embark on a journey of self-discovery, personal growth, and increased productivity. This Flutter-based application offers a unique blend of features that are tailored to your individual personality type. It's a small but passionate project developed by a dedicated team of two college students.

## Features

- **Personalized Extensions:** InnerQuest offers a variety of plug-and-play extensions that are customized to align with your unique personality type. These extensions help you enhance your personal development and productivity.

- **Mood Points System:** Stay motivated with our mood point system. Earn points by being productive, and use them to unlock further features, extensions, and rewards.

- **Empowerment Through NFTs:** Every achievement in InnerQuest is backed by real Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain. This not only gamifies your personal growth but also offers a tangible representation of your accomplishments.

- **Open Source Community:** We are strong advocates of open-source development. InnerQuest is a project designed for the community and by the community. We encourage other developers to contribute and help us shape the future of InnerQuest.
